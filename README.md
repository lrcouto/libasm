February 20th 2021 - Just starting the project and trying to get familiar with what assembly languages are and how to use them. For now, I'm just messing around and not coding anything yet. Got some books I need to read.

February 25th 2021 - Wrote a "Hello, World!" code. This stuff is very counter-intuitive, but I think it's starting to make some sense.

February 26th 2021 - More studying, a couple more tests, and I think I got enough of a grasp of the syntax to start writing the functions. I'm starting with a Makefile so I can link/compile them.
