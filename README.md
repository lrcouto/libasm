February 20th 2021 - Just starting the project and trying to get familiar with what assembly languages are and how to use them. For now, I'm just messing around and not coding anything yet. Got some books I need to read.

February 25th 2021 - Wrote a "Hello, World!" code. This stuff is very counter-intuitive, but I think it's starting to make some sense.

February 26th 2021 - More studying, a couple more tests, and I think I got enough of a grasp of the syntax to start writing the functions. I'm starting with a Makefile so I can link/compile them.

February 27th 2021 - Somewhat productive day - lost a lot of time struggling with my Makefile, but managed to set it up properly and get three of the six required functions done and tested. Not too bad. It's 4am and I'm making stupid syntax errors, so it's time to sleep.

February 28th 2021 - Finished writing all the six functions. Still need to write tests for ft_strdup and figure out how to set up tests for error conditions. Spent all night trying to figure out a weird behavior on ft_read and now that I solved the mystery I can go to bed.

March 1st 2021 - Finished writing all the test functions and, unless I decide to be incredibly pedantic, I'm done with this project.

March 1st 2021 pt. 2 - I am incredibly pedantic, poked around with -fsanitize flags and found a write access violation causing a segfault. Fixed it, and now I'm done for real. :triumph:
